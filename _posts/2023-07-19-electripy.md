Welcome to **ElectriPy**, a powerful and interactive electrostatic simulator designed to help you gain an intuitive understanding of how electric fields and charges behave. Created as a personal project to visualize the principles of physics, ElectriPy lets you play with electrons and protons, observing how the electric field changes as you add more charges to the simulation.

ElectriPy was developed as a user-friendly and engaging tool to facilitate the exploration of electrostatics. Unlike precise calculators, ElectriPy emphasizes simulation and learning through interactive play. Whether you are a student, an educator, or simply someone curious about the fascinating world of physics, this simulator is here to spark your interest and deepen your understanding of electric fields.

## Physics

This section explains the physics of ElectriPy. If you want to see its implementation on Python you can go to ElectriPy [physics package](https://github.com/dylannalex/electripy/tree/main/electripy/physics) on GitHub. While following the logic and formulas below it is important to consider that all charges are point charges (i.e. their mass is negligible) and are at rest.

### Electric force calculation

#### Two point charges

Imagine we have a plane with two **point charges at rest**, $$ q_0 $$ and $$ q_1 $$:

![png](/assets/img/posts/2023-07-19-electripy/two_point_charges_and_electric_force.png)

$$ q_0 $$ exerts an electric force $$ \vec{\textbf{F}}_0 $$ on $$ q_1 $$,
and $$ q_1 $$ exerts an electric force $$ \vec{\textbf{F}}_1 $$ on $$ q_0 $$.
These electric forces have the same magnitude but opposite direction. We can calculate the
electric forces' magnitude with Coulomb's law:

$$F = \frac{1}{4\pi\varepsilon_0}\frac{\|q_0q_1\|}{r^2}$$

Nevertheless, we need to find the electric forces vector, not only their magnitude. To
simplify our task we are going to analyze the electric force exerted only on $$ q_0 $$,
which is $$ \vec{\textbf{F}}_1 $$. Since we now have one force, we will call it 
$$ \vec{\textbf{F}} $$. In other words, $$ \vec{\textbf{F}}_1 $$ = $$ \vec{\textbf{F}} $$.

![png](/assets/img/posts/2023-07-19-electripy/two_point_charges_and_r_vector.png)

$$ \vec{\textbf{r}} $$ is a vector that goes from $$ q_0 $$ to $$ q_1 $$. However is more useful to find
$$ \hat{\textbf{r}} $$, which has the same direction as $$ \vec{\textbf{r}} $$ but it is a unit vector. $$ \hat{\textbf{r}} $$ can be easily
calculated by scaling $$ \vec{\textbf{r}} $$ by the inverse of its norm: $$\hat{\textbf{r}}=\frac{\vec{\textbf{r}}}{\|\vec{\text{r}}\|}$$

In this scenario, $$ \vec{\textbf{F}} $$ can be calculated as $$ F\hat{\textbf{r}} $$. This
is not always the case though. What would happen if $$ q_1 $$ was a positive charge?:

![png](/assets/img/posts/2023-07-19-electripy/two_point_charges_and_r_vector_2.png)

Here the electric force has changed, it is now calculated as $$ \vec{\textbf{F}}=-F\hat{\textbf{r}} $$.

As we see, the direction of $$ \vec{\textbf{F}} $$ does not only depend on $$ q_0 $$ and
$$ q_1 $$ magnitude but also on their sign. By analyzing some other examples we can deduce 
that $$ \vec{\textbf{F}} $$ is:

$$\vec{\textbf{F}}=-\frac{1}{4\pi\varepsilon_0}\frac{q_0q_1}{r^2}\hat{\textbf{r}}$$

#### Multiple point charges

Now let's imagine that we have three point charges:

![png](/assets/img/posts/2023-07-19-electripy/three_point_charges_and_electric_force.png)

If we look at $$ q_0 $$ we can observe that it suffers a force $$ \vec{\textbf{F}}_1 $$
exerted by $$ q_1 $$ and a force $$ \vec{\textbf{F}}_2 $$ exerted by $$ q_2 $$. The
net force exerted on $$ q_0 $$ is $$ \vec{\textbf{F}} $$, which is the sum of $$ \vec{\textbf{F}}_1 $$
and $$ \vec{\textbf{F}}_2 $$. This is called the Principle of Superposition and it is fulfilled
for any charge distribution.

Given a distribution of $$ n $$ charges $$ \\{q_0,q_1,\ldots,q_n\\} $$, the electric
force exerted on $$ q_0 $$ is $$ \vec{\textbf{F}} $$ and can be calculated as:

$$\vec{\textbf{F}}=\sum_i\vec{\textbf{F}}_i$$

After replacing $$ \vec{\textbf{F}}_i $$ by its value:

$$\vec{\textbf{F}}=\sum_i-\frac{1}{4\pi\varepsilon_0}\frac{q_0q_i}{r_i^2}\hat{\textbf{r}}_i$$

We can optimize this by taking the constants values outside of the summatory:

$$\vec{\textbf{F}}=-\frac{1}{4\pi\varepsilon_0}\sum_i\frac{q_0q_i}{r_i^2}\hat{\textbf{r}}_i$$

We have arrived to a formula for calculating the electric net force of a given charge on an electric
field distribution.


### Electric field calculation

The electric field is defined mathematically as a vector field that associates to each point in space
the force per unit of charge exerted on an infinitesimal positive test charge at rest at that point.

Given a test charge $$ q_0 $$ at a point $$ P(x,y) $$ and a charge distribution $$ \\{q_1,q_2,\ldots,q_n\\} $$, we can calculate the electric field at $$ P $$ position as:

$$\vec{\textbf{E}}=\frac{\vec{\textbf{F}}}{q_0}$$

Where $$ \vec{\textbf{E}} $$ is the electric field vector at position $$ P $$, and
$$ \vec{\textbf{F}} $$ is the electric force exerted on $$ q_0 $$ by the charge distribution. If we
replace $$ \vec{\textbf{F}} $$ by its value we get the formula to calculate the electric field at any
point:

$$\vec{\textbf{E}}=-\frac{1}{4\pi\varepsilon_0}\sum_i\frac{q_i}{r_i^2}\hat{\textbf{r}}_i$$

Where $$ r_i $$ is the distance from the point $$ P $$ to the charge $$ q_i $$ and $$ \hat{\textbf{r}}_i $$
is the unit vector with the same direction as $$ \vec{\textbf{r}}_i $$, the vector that goes from $$ P $$ to
the charge $$ q_i $$.
