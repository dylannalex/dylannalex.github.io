## Why follow UdemyPy?

- ***It's totally free***. You only need to create a Udemy account. You don't
  need to add any payment method.
- ***You can learn anything***. UdemyPy doesn't filter courses. You will find
  courses on any category and language.
- ***It's completely legal***. In fact, UdemyPy helps Udemy content creators
  reach more audience.

## How does it work?

In order to increment their audience, content creators on Udemy can set a discount
to their courses. UdemyPy looks for 100% discount coupons and shares them.  

When looking for free courses shared by UdemyPy, remember to check the offer time
left. Once it's expired, the course will no longer be free.

Whenever you find a course you like, click on the link and enroll in it. Despite
the fact that courses are free only for a limited amount of time, once you are
enrolled ***they will be yours forever!***
