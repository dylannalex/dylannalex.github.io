_A circle $$ C_a $$ inscribed in a square $$ S $$._

Consider a random variable $$ B \sim \text{Uniform}(0, a) $$, the random variables $$ X, Y \sim \text{Uniform}(-a, a) $$, the outcomes $$ b \in B $$, $$ x \in X $$ and $$ y \in Y $$, and a real number $$ \rho \in [0, 1) $$.

Find the probability of observing an outcome $$ b $$ such that the probability of a circle $$ C_b $$ with radius $$ b $$ centered at $$ P = (x, y) $$ being fully contained within $$ C_a $$ is greater than $$ \rho $$.

## Solution

### Probability of $$ C_b \subseteq C_a $$

Let's consider a point $$ P $$ inside the square $$ S $$. The circle $$ C_b $$ is described by the circumference of radius $$ b $$ centered at $$ P $$. If $$ C_b $$ is fully contained in $$ C_a $$, then $$ P $$ must be inside $$ C_a $$, and the distance between $$ P $$ and the circumference of $$ C_a $$ must be greater than $$ b $$.

This means that $$ C_b $$ is fully contained in $$ C_a $$ if and only if its center $$ P $$ is inside the circle $$ C_{ab} $$ of radius $$ a-b $$ centered at the origin.

Then the probability that $$ C_b $$ is fully contained in $$ C_a $$ is the ratio between the area of $$ C_{ab} $$ and the area of $$ S $$:

$$
\mathbb{P}\{C_b \subseteq C_a\} = \frac{\pi (a-b)^2}{(2a)^2} = \frac{\pi}{4} \frac{(a-b)^2}{a^2}
$$

### Probability of $$ \mathbb{P}(C_b \subseteq C_a) > \rho $$

We are looking for the probability of observing an outcome $$ b $$ such that

$$
\mathbb{P}\{C_b \subseteq C_a\} > \rho
$$

that is

$$
\frac{\pi}{4} \frac{(a-b)^2}{a^2} > \rho
$$

By clearing $$ b $$ from the inequality, we get

$$
b < a \left(1 - \sqrt{\frac{4}{\pi} \rho }\right)
$$

As $$ B $$ is a uniformly distributed within the interval $$ [0, a] $$, its probability density function is:

$$
f(x) = 
     \begin{cases}
       \frac{1}{a} &\quad\text{if } 0 \le x \le a\\
       0 &\quad\text{otherwise.} \\ 
     \end{cases}
$$

Then the probability of $$ b < a \left(1 - \sqrt{\frac{4}{\pi} \rho }\right) $$ is simply the area of the rectangle with height $$ \frac{1}{a} $$ and base $$ a \left(1 - \sqrt{\frac{4}{\pi} \rho }\right) $$

$$
P\Big\{b < a \left(1 - \sqrt{\frac{4}{\pi} \rho }\right)\Big\} = \frac{1}{a} \cdot a \left(1 - \sqrt{\frac{4}{\pi} \rho }\right) = 1 - \sqrt{\frac{4}{\pi} \rho }
$$

Therefore, the probability of observing an outcome $$ b $$ such that $$ \mathbb{P} $${$$ C_b \subseteq C_a $$}$$  > \rho $$ is

$$
\therefore \mathbb{P}\Big\{\mathbb{P}\{C_b \subseteq C_a\} > \rho\Big\} = 1 - \sqrt{\frac{4}{\pi} \rho }
$$
